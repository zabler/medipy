Berger algorithm implemented in Python by Nicolas Zabler, 2022.

This file contains an algorithm, developed by [1] in 1986 to resample and interpolate an non-equidistant list of r-peaks, extracted from an ECG into a RR intervall time series.
According to [2], the algorithm is goo.. this algorithm is better than other

Input
rr: List of RR intervals in ms
resample_fs: Resample Frequency

Output
Vector with equidistant, resampled and interpolated RR interval values

Recommendations
Use a resample frequency which is a multiple of the origin sample frequency, so the resulting interpolated RR array is easy to contenate
